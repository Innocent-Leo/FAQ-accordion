## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice:

- Writing JavaScript logic to handle **accordion open/close toggle behavior**
- Using `.addEventListener()` for both mouse clicks and **keyboard interactions**
- Managing `aria-expanded` attributes for **better accessibility support**
- Structuring my HTML to allow **tab navigation and focus states**

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to explore further:

- Adding smooth **CSS transitions/animations** to the accordion open/close
- Improving keyboard accessibility by supporting **arrow key navigation** between accordion items
- Exploring how to create a fully **accessible accordion component pattern** used in design systems
